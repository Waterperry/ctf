    "# Jailbreaking Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Jailbreaking an LLM involves getting it to output a response that it has been trained or prompted to avoid. \n",
    "Examples of this could be outputting instructions for creating harmful materials, outputting offensive language, or revealing sensitive information. \n",
    "There are many possible ways of achieving this, but they fall into two broad categories: token-level and prompt-level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Token-level Jailbreaks\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs see text through tokens, which don't quite resemble words. \n",
    "Most modern LLMs use sub-word tokenization, which means tokens are smaller than words (in general). \n",
    "For example, the words \"Hello World!\" might be tokenized as follows: [\"He\", \"llo\", \" W\", \"or\", \"ld!\"]. \n",
    "These tokens are converted to token IDs (integers) which are used as input to the LLM.\n",
    "The LLM then generates a sequence of token IDs as output, which are converted back into natural language.\n",
    "The mapping of token IDs -> words and vice versa is handled by a **tokenizer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Token-level jailbreaks, as the name suggests, operate at the token-level.\n",
    "This means that instead of using human-comprehensible input to achieve the jailbreak, the input might look like a string of random characters. \n",
    "This string of random characters manipulate the internal workings of the LLM in some fashion to achieve unintended behaviours.\n",
    "However, these attacks can require a lot of trial and error (in the order of hundreds of thousands of prompts) in order to get right, so we'll consider these out of scope for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt-level Jailbreaks\n",
    "\n",
    "The second category of jailbreak is the prompt-level jailbreak. \n",
    "Rather than manipulating tokens in some uninterpretable way, these use natural language and some more classical social engineering tricks in order to deceive the LLM into obeying the harmful instruction.\n",
    "These take considerably more human involvement and intuition than token-level jailbreaks, although some research [(PAIR)](https://jailbreaking-llms.github.io/) has managed to automate this process using LLMs to reduce effort and human involvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Goals of a Jailbreak\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, the general goal of a jailbreak is to get the LLM to output sensitive or harmful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Prompt Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way of aligning an LLM with your particular use case is to define a system prompt.\n",
    "This is a developer-created string of text that is prepended to each user interaction. \n",
    "As this does not require creating a dataset or fine-tuning a model, it is much easier than other methods, and so it is widely used.\n",
    "However, often the system prompt will be poorly configured or will contain sensitive information.\n",
    "Such information could be company secrets, API keys (if the developers wished to provide the model with the ability to talk to external systems), \n",
    "Some examples of previous system prompt leaks can be found [here](https://github.com/jujumilk3/leaked-system-prompts/blob/main/anthropic-claude-3-haiku_20240712.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bad RAG (Sensitive Information Exfiltration)\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a popular way of enabling a model to access a company's information without having to explicitly train the model on that data.\n",
    "The way it works is:\n",
    "0. The company's information is split into chunks (think paragraphs) and stored in some kind of database (usually a vector database).\n",
    "1. When a user makes a query, this query is forwarded to the database. Chunks that might be useful when answering the query are returned (**retrieval**).\n",
    "2. These chunks are prepended to the user's query (**augmentation**), and this whole block of text is sent to the LLM. \n",
    "3. The LLM then outputs a response which is highly likely to be of higher quality than if it did not have access to the chunks (**generation**).\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this is that, if the chunks in the database are selected poorly, this can embed sensitive information in the LLM's response.\n",
    "Imagine a scenario where the company's information is a set of Confluence pages, and this has been chunked and stored in a database.\n",
    "Any user query discussing \"architecture\" or \"API keys\" could easily cause the LLM to repeat sensitive information to the user.\n",
    "This could empower an insider threat, or create a potential channel for privilege escalation by an outside attacker with access to an LLM generation endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bad RAG (Context Window Overflow)\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs have an internal limitation called their **context window**.\n",
    "Essentially, it is a window which limits how much text the LLM can operate on while generating new text.\n",
    "It is defined in terms of number of tokens.\n",
    "When the chat history length exceeds this internal limitation, the LLM will start processing **only the most recent** N tokens, ignoring all the initial tokens as they are now outside the context window.\n",
    "This is a problem in its own right, but can be exacerbated by a poor RAG implementation.\n",
    "Recall before that the **system prompt** is prepended to the user's messages - RAG now prepends even more information to the user's messages, increasing the total token count.\n",
    "With a sufficiently broad query (which returns a lot of chunks from the database), the user can easily overflow the context window.\n",
    "This is a problem because, if programmed incorrectly, this is pushing out information from the system prompt, causing the LLM to forget its imposed restrictions and guidelines, and in some cases can cause sensitive information leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prompt-level Jailbreaking Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pretexting\n",
    "\n",
    "A common social engineering technique used by physical pentesters is pretexting - constructing a fabricated scenario, or pretext, to gain trust and manipulate people into allowing access to locations or systems that are off-limits to the general public.\n",
    "This turns out to work pretty well for LLMs too - for example, tricking an LLM into thinking it is in [\"Developer Mode\"](https://www.lakera.ai/blog/jailbreaking-large-language-models-guide) can cause it to ignore its programming and reveal sensitive information.\n",
    "Alternatively, tricking it into thinking that *you* are the developer interacting with it in a debugging environment can also cause it to reveal things that it would not reveal in a normal conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memorization\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to memorize certain strings during training.\n",
    "Although the exact method by which this occurs is debated, it is known that it happens.\n",
    "It can be a vector for attack if an attacker is aware that strings of a certain form appear frequently in the training data.\n",
    "An example of such a string in programming \"copilots\" might be something like: `api_key = \"...\"`\n",
    "When prompting a programming copilot to auto-complete such a line, they can repeat memorized information from their training data: [example](https://spectralops.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image1.png)\n",
    "![xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/predictive_models.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, providing input and/or requesting output in a different language (or, in certain models, in [Base64](https://florian.github.io/base64/)) can bypass keyword filters (externally imposed by developers by parsing responses) or even internal restrictions on generated content (which are requested in the system prompt / by fine-tuning) and cause the LLM to reveal sensitive information."
